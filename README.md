# README 

Have you followed [Rosemary Wang](https://joatmon08.github.io/01_about.html)? She's a legend! She [works](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosemarywang/) at Hashicorp as [a developer advocate](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/authors/rosemary-wang), and 99% of the demo in this repository is her work, teachings, effort. You could fit through the eye of a needle the contributions I made to this repository and effort; everything else was her! Thank you Rosemary! 

Also, she's got this amazing book [_Infrastructure as Code, Patterns and Practices: With examples in Python and Terraform_](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Practices-Infrastructure-Code-Terraform/dp/1617298298), which is well worth a read if and when you're working with Terraform!
